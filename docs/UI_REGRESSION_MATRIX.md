# Native UI regression matrix

Run only when the user authorizes testing. Source tests live in `WeldingGasWalletUITests`; this checklist covers visual and policy-sensitive cases automation cannot prove.

| Destination | Size / mode | Required checks |
|---|---|---|
| Small iPhone | current compact supported iPhone, portrait | no clipping; onboarding fits; checkbox and legal links reachable; keyboard does not hide action; paywall price/period/restore/legal visible |
| Large iPhone | portrait and landscape | readable line lengths; sheets dismiss; bottom navigation and optional banner do not overlap |
| iPad | compact and regular split/full screen | adaptive sidebar/tab behavior; no empty unusable column; sheets and forms remain bounded |
| Accessibility | largest accessibility Dynamic Type | scrolling preserves every action; labels do not truncate meaning; 44-point targets |
| VoiceOver | iPhone and iPad | logical order; icons have labels; purchase price/period and restore are announced |
| RTL | Arabic or Hebrew pseudolocalized build | navigation, chevrons, text alignment and directional icons mirror correctly |
| Localization | every advertised locale | no raw keys, accidental English, clipped price/period or untranslated legal/purchase text |
| Onboarding | first install and revised legal version | exactly one explicit acceptance gate; links readable before acceptance; re-consent triggers after version change |
| Commerce | one-time, subscription, cap exhausted, pending, cancelled, failure, restore | accurate StoreKit terms; no app logo/icon/brand asset; no false unlock; recovery is clear |
| Ads target | consent required/not required/error; remove-ads bought | no request before consent permits; privacy choices available; banner above navigation; removed after verified entitlement |
| Ad-free target | default `Shell` archive | no banner gap; no Google SDK linkage; no GAD/SKAdNetwork metadata |
| Backup option | disabled and app-enabled provider | no UI/capability when disabled; explicit conflict choice; failed restore preserves device data |

Required automation destinations when execution is authorized:

- A compact supported iPhone simulator.
- A current large iPhone simulator.
- A current iPad simulator.
- English, Spanish and an RTL locale.
- Default and accessibility Dynamic Type sizes.
